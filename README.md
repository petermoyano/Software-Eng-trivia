# Software-Eng-trivia
The rainy app is a web site built and deployed with the purpose of creating a space to do some knowlegde testing, regarding various Software Engineering related concepts.
In this site you can ask for some quizes (you can choose the topic, difficulty and number of questions), and once you submit your answers you can check how many you got right
and what the right anwers where. 
The rainy context is purely arbitrary. Or maybe you can think about it like it's raining knowlegde, your choice.
